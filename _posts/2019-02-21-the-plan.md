Here it is! I know you have been waiting. The exciement building. You've been on the edge of your seat. You've had that shaky feeling in your knees. Then you started hearing the whispers *"a website"* , from *"Phil Usher"*, *"I know!"*. The rumours grew so loud, that you had to check it. So you made it. To find the start of dream. The ambitions of a young man and his quest to write a website. Here is his lowly humble plan.

## Aims

The aims of the website are to share a bit about what I do. Show of some examples of my work and to continue on my quest of constant improvement by learning and trying out new technologies. Here are some of the ideas I hope to implement shortly;

## Scientific Publications

A list of my scientific publications of all variety. Including my thesis, published papers, and conference abstracts. There may be a delay on my most recent work due to publsiher embargos but I will try and get everything avaiable. 

## CV

Or Resume for those on the other side of pond. This will be an updated resume, taht can hopefully be formatted to pdf for distrubution.

##  Projects

I will also look after any of my code projects here in one place. I have a few projects from PhD work that are shareable and also some ideas of upcomming projects. But first the website.

## Blog

I will document the process of my "projects" and also any research work, maybe some "response" or "opinion" pieces. I would be happy to accept some commments.
